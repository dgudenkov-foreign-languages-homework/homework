    Hi, my name is Pasha, I work for the BBC as a producer and I do a lot of DJing in my spare time. I have lived in London for many years now with my friends and sometimes I annoy them with my music. What about you? Do you have any annoying habits?

    - I guess a lot of students just not fast about that
    - We've always got on really well and had a really nice experience
    - So, in return, I would play music late at night when they were trying to sleep just to get my own time
    - Smoking would be definitely up there! Can't stand smokers
    - Everything else is really not a big deal, but when you're flat-sharing definitely tidiness is very important
    - Not tidying up after themselves, leaving a mess after cooking - that sort of so
