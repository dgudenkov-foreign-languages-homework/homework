    - Yourpick.net. My name's Dave. How can I help you?
    - Hi, I'm phoning to find out about a DVD I ordered. The reference number is 3714.
    - OK. Is there a problem?
    - Yes, it hasn't arrived yet and I ordered it a month ago. Could you tell me when I can expect it?
    - Bear with me a moment. I'm afraid we have no information about the arrival date.
    - And you don't know when it will be in?
    - It's coming from the USA, so I'm afraid not. Do you want to cancel?
    - No, but I'd be grateful if you could look into it.
    - No problem at all.
    - And would there be any chance of phoning me when it arrives?
    - Sure... let me check just if we have your phone number...
