To local council:

I'm writing with regard to the issue with the no-parking sign behind the tree.

Recently I parked a car on Baker street 221 and I thought it was legal because I didn't see any sign there. But when I returned to the car I was shocked, because I found a parking fine! When I looked around I could hardly find a no-parking sign behind the tree. In my opinion, it is unfair - hiding a no-parking sign behind trees and giving fines.

I have consulted a lawyer about this situation, who has advised me to contact you in writing.

To resolve this situation I request that you cut the tree that hides a sign in two weeks to prevent further fines for other people. In addition, I ask you to cancel my fine.

Please contact me within one week of the date of this letter to confirm that these steps have been taken. If you need to reach me by phone, my number is 8-800-555-35-35.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

Sherlock Holmes (Mr)
