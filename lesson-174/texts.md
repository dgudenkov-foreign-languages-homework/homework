A bicycles you can fold up

Folding bicycles have been around for quite some time now. However, an amazing new Japanese version might be folded with a swiftness and efficiency never seen before. This bike is designed smart that is possible to fold it up quickly. Once folded, you pull the bike along stairs ease.

This remarkable bike has a half-folding frame with a hinge in the middle. And, although the basic idea is not original, its inventor has created an especially clever variation, combining compactness lightness convenience with smart design.

Recently folding bicycles have become very popular in Japan, particularly in congested urban areas in Tokyo, a city where every square centimetre of space is in great demand. Japanese cyclists need to be able to store their bikes in tiny areas at home or office. And because they should want to take their bicycle on the underground, a folding model is a big advantage/




Animal communication

It is sometimes said that animals use language. Certainly, some animal species have developed amazingly sophisticated ways of communicating with one another.

But there are huge differences between the ways animals communicate and the ways human begins do. When animals make a sound, such as a bark or a call, it is a reaction to things is happening around them. An alarm call means they are frightened. A hunger call means they want food. Animals, though, cannot make a call meaning 'I was scared yesterday' or 'I'll be hungry tomorrow'.Only human beings are capable of doing this.

Zoologists have had some success in teaching human language to animals. In some famous experiments, chimpanzees have been taught to use their hands to give information on a range of things. Some animals have even managed to put signs together in words to make simple sentences. However, getting them to do this takes a huge time of training.
