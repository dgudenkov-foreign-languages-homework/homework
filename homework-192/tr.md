Have you ever felt like you are being watched at work? According to the recent research of the American's manager's association, about 32% of big American companies are record and track the actions and communications of their employees when they are at work. Obviously, surveillance technologies are often used in companies to monitor employees' activities easier. Basically, I think that monitoring of internet traffic usage and personal email is a good practice and quite fair, although I don't like it and I totally disagree with such actions. As I know not all companies install CCTV cameras in their offices and I really think that it's quite reasonable. For instance, there is Jack's company where he constantly plays computer games at work. Personally, I think that it's outrageous and quite anxious. He, of course, says that it's a good point but he's not afraid of management or judgment, because nobody tracks his activity at work due to the lack of CCTV cameras.
