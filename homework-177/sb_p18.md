    - I'd like to enquire about train times to Vienna
    - Can you tell me which train I need to take to get to Vienna by 3 p.m.?
    - Can I ask how far it is from the western to the southern train station?
    - Do you mind me asking where I can get information on local transport in Vienna?
    - I was wondering if I need to book a seat on the train?
    - Could you tell me if I can book on the phone?
    - I was wondering if you could book it for me?
    - I'd be grateful if you could send me an email confirmation?
