Lately, I tried a lot of different courses, for example, driving courses, foreign language courses, fitness, but I donâ€™t like anything. Herewith, many courses have a free trial for newcomers and even 50% sale for groups, two for one deal. But in that case, courses ask for a non-refundable deposit or fill in your details on their website, to have time to sign up for a free lesson with a qualified trainer. I'd like to enquire about the experience I would like to have the most. My friends often ask me the same questions: "Karla, we would be grateful, if you would tell us what do you want and how can we really fascinate and surprise you" or "Karla, is there any chance of you finally do something really amusing for you and stop investigate about all courses in the city? We would be grateful if you tell us if it is negotiable.
