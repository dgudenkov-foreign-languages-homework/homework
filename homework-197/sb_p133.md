Missing child found safe and sound

A search for a missing child in East Paterson ended happily last week after five-year old Ricky Ross was found asleep in his own room. Last Monday, Julie Ross, the boy's mother was working in the front garden when she heard her son cry out. He was playing in the living room but when she had run to the house, she had seen that the back door was open and there was no sign of her son.
Neighbours joined in the search and when they were searching in the forest behind the house, they found a few pieces of children's clothing. There was initial panic but is was soon clear that the clothing had been there for years and didn't belong to the boy. Ricky was eventually found by another who went into the boy's room while the search was going on because she heard a noise from the toy box. When she opened it there was Ricky safe and sound - he had been sleeping in the toy box he whole time, unaware ofthe panic he had caused.
