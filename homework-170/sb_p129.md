        Dear Mum and Dad
        Sorry, I haven't written in a while, but things are crazy there. I can't believe it have been six months ago that I left and that we haven't seen each other for that long.
        This trip was fantastic so far, at least until a few days ago, when things took a turn for the worse. We arrived in the city centre and checked into the first hotel we saw. Now, you know I have stayed in a lot of one-star hotels in my life, but this one was really bad, so we decided to go straight out to see the city.
        Unfortunately we forgot to lock our room, and when we got back, our luggage and most of money was gone. We called to police station several times since then, but no one handed in any of our things.
        Anyway, could you send me $1000, please?
        Thanks and love,
        Joanna
