    - I have always been afraid of water, but I finally learned to swim in the summer. Now I'd like to try diving
    - I have just got a high-quality video camera: my sister gave it to me for my birthday. So I'd like to learn how to edit a film
    - I love music and I have played the piano for many years now, but there's one instrument I haven't tried so far: the guitar
    - I have never bought anything online - I'm paranoid about giving my credit card details, but I know it's cheaper, so that would be my choice
    - Hiking in the Alps. I have lived in Austria since I was born, and everyone in my family have gone to the Alps hiking loads of times. But somehow I still haven't done a proper hike
