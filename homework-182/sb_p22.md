    My top three ideas are food, water and atibiotics. I think these three thing the most important for human survivability. Good food and water can help people get important vitamins to live longer. But the most important thing is resistance to antibiotics. Now we have a number of bacterias that have resistance for well known antibiotics, and sciensists have to invent newer types of antibiotics. But new types of antibiotics could be worse for our health and we might need more time to restore after taking them. And some time later bacterias could get a full immune for antibiotics, and this could mean the complete extinction of humanity...
