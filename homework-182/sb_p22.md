     My top three are food, water, and antibiotics. I think these three things are the most important for human survivability. Good food and water can help people get important vitamins to live longer. But the most important thing is resistance to antibiotics. Now we have a number of bacterias that have resistance to well-known antibiotics, and scientists have to invent newer types of antibiotics. But new types of antibiotics could be worse for our health and we might need more time to restore after taking them. And some time later bacterias could get full immunity for antibiotics, and this could mean the complete extinction of humanity ...
