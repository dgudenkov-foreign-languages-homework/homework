    I have been travelling all my life and I have visited more than twenty-five countries, many of them less rich than my own. I have often wanted to take something to repay people for their hospitality but I have never known what to choose. Anyway, recently I have explored a number of websites that give advice and I have found a great one called stuffyourruck-sack.com. It was created by Kate Humble, who has been presenting wildlife programmers on television for many years. It's a beautifully simple idea: the website matches up charities that need stuff with people who are willing to provide and deliver it. Travellers have told the website about 187 organisations in eighty-one countries, and these include schools needing books or footballs, orphanages needing clothes and toys and trade organisations needing mobiles. So far it looks as if the response has been good and the website have recently appeared in 'Find of the Year' survey of new sites
